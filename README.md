## **Project Initialization**

The project was initialized using Spring Initializr with the following dependencies:

Spring Cloud (for microservice architecture)

Eureka Discovery (for service registration and discovery)

Spring Web (for building RESTful APIs)

MySQL Driver (for database connectivity)

Spring Data JPA (for database operations)

To recreate the project, use Spring Initializr and include the above dependencies.




# **Configuration**
Group ID: com.example

Artifact Name: order-service

Application Name: Order Service

Database Schema: order_db

Ensure the application.properties or application.yml file is configured with the correct database connection details and Eureka server URL.

Entity Creation
The Order entity represents an order in the system. It includes the following fields:

id (Order ID)

productId (associated product ID)

quantity (amount of product ordered)

orderDate (date/time of the order)

orderStatus (status of the order)

amount (total amount for the order)




# **Database Schema**

The database schema is named order_db. The Order entity is mapped to the orders table in the database using JPA annotations.

Controller Layer
The OrderController class handles incoming HTTP requests and maps them to appropriate service methods.



# **Service Layer**
The OrderService interface and its implementation handle business logic and interact with the repository layer.




# **Error Handling and API Design**
The application includes error handling for scenarios such as:

Order not found

Invalid order data

Internal server errors




# **Integration with Other Services**
The Order Service interacts with other microservices (e.g., Product and Payment Services) using REST APIs. Use RestTemplate or WebClient for inter-service communication.




# **Running the Application**
Ensure MySQL and Eureka Server are running.

Update the application.properties file with the correct database and Eureka server details.





# **API Endpoints**
Place Order: POST /order/place

Get Order: GET /order/{id}



# **Dependencies**
Spring Boot

Spring Cloud

Spring Data JPA

MySQL Driver

Lombok (for boilerplate code reduction)
